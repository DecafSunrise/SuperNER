abc = "Philosophers often understand emergence as a claim about the etiology of a system's properties. An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. Nicolai Hartmann (1882â€“1950), one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence, termed this a categorial novum (new category)."
